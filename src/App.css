    * This file is now mostly empty because we are relying on Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
    * for styling. Any styles defined here might conflict with Tailwind's utility classes
    * and DaisyUI's component styles.
    *
    * Only add truly global, non-Tailwind-replicable styles here, or
    * use @apply for creating custom components from Tailwind utilities.

    /*
    * Example of a very specific global rule if absolutely necessary:
    * html {
    * scroll-behavior: smooth;
    * }

    /*
    * If you had a specific custom font not handled by the body apply in index.css, you could import it here:
    * @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap');
    */

    /*
    * Any custom classes from previous iterations that are still referenced in JSX
    * but not directly replaced by Tailwind/DaisyUI should be removed or converted.
    * For instance, if 'main-content-container' is still used, its styles should
    * be moved directly to the JSX using Tailwind classes like:
    * <div className="p-4 max-w-screen-xl mx-auto my-5 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
